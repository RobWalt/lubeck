# Goals
This repository tries to continue the work started in
[JasonShin's](https://github.com/JasonShin) crate
[fp-core.rs](https://github.com/JasonShin/fp-core.rs).

The goal of this repository is to make concepts from functional languages like
Haskell available in Rust in form of a library while keeping them as
easy-to-use as possible.

A secondary goal is the creation of a book which not only documents the library
and its components but at the same functions as a learning resource for people
who want to get their feet wet with functional programming in general and have
no prior experience.
